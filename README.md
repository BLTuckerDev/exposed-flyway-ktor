# Ktor, Exposed, and Flyway
This project is a sample that accompanies this [blog post](https://github.com/BLTuckerDev/exposed-flyway-ktor)

It is meant to demonstrate how you can use flyway, ktor, and exposed together to build a modern web application.

This project serves as a hands-on example using this tech:

- **Ktor**: A lightweight, unopinionated web framework for Kotlin.

- **Exposed**: A type-safe SQL library for Kotlin, keeping database interactions clean and safe.

- **Flyway**: A robust, version-control-based tool for managing database schema migrations.
